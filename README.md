The code and *only* the code is under the MIT license.

To open the project, you'll need version 3.4.5 of Godot, which you can get here - https://godotengine.org/download/archive/3.4.5-stable/

For the backgrounds you can use this tool to make them https://mrpedrobraga.itch.io/modot-distortionator
since this version of the addon is newer than the one in the source code, download the Godot Integration Addon 1.0.5 
from the page and add it to the project's addons folder
